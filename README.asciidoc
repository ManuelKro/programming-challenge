== My Solution for the Programming Challenge

In this repository you will find my solution to your programming challenge for the upcoming job interview.

My program consists of the following 5 different classes and your start class App.java

- **readCSVcountries.java** to read the countries.csv file and save it to a list
- **readCSVweather.java** to read the weather.csv file and save it to a list
- **Countries.java** to store the different columns from the countries.csv file
- **weather.java** to store the different columns from the weather.csv file
- **equations.java** to calculate the two searched values over two generated hash maps

Additional annotations and comments are also implemented in the source code of the classes.
